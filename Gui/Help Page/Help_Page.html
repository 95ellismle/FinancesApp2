   The minimum amount required to plot any graph is to set the ydata parameter. This can be set the same as any other parameter, by typing the parameter followed by a colon, and the list of plotting parameters ended with a semi-colon. An example is given below:
   <center>
      <code>parameter: item1, item2, ..., itemN ;</code>
   </center>
<br>
   An example command to plot the Balance against the Date is given below:
<blockquote>
   <code>
       ydata: Balance;
       <br>
       xdata: Date;
   </code>
</blockquote>
White space is ignored, so is the case of the characters. Any line that begins with a '#' is ignored and can be used to comment.

   The current list of parameters which can be set are given as follows:
   <ul>
      <li> Ydata -Sets the ydata to plot </li>
      <li> Xdata -Sets the xdata to plot</li>
      <li> Colour -Sets the colours of the plots</li>
      <li> Linestyle (Ls) -Sets the linestyles of the plots.</li>
   </ul>
   The backend package used to plot the data is matplotlib so I have kept the syntax pretty similar to that.
