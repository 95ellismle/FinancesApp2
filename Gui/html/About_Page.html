<h1>About</h1>
<p>
   I have built this app in order to help managing long term personal
   finances much easier. As well as having the ability to display banking
   data and categorise it, the app also allows the user to search for
   particular phrases within a statement and gives a breakdown of the
   spending. This data can also be plotted and in the future predictive
   capabilities will be added.

<h3>Using the app</h3>
<p>
   For the most part I hope the app is intuitive and simple to use.
   However, there are a few tricks to know to make the most of it.
   <h4>Table Page:</h4>
   Cntrl-F is used to search through the statement data. This will open a
   panel to the right of the displayed data. From here you can search each
   account for particular phrases. Dates can set by pressing the words
   date1 and date2 below the search bar. Certain categories can be
   excluded from the search by unchecking the checkboxes below the search bar. Finally regular expressions (RegEx) can be used for a more powerful search (a very good intro can be found <a href="https://regexone.com/">here</a>). Searches are not case sensitive.
