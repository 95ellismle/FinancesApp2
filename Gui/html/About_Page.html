<h1>About</h1>
<p>
   I have built this app in order to help managing long term personal finances much easier. As well as having the ability to display banking data and categorise it, the app also allows the user to search for particular phrases within a statement and gives a breakdown of the spending in a small bar chart. This data can also be plotted and in the future predictive
   capabilities will be added.

   Currently only data in the format of TSB accounts have been tested.

<h3>Using the app</h3>
<p>
   For the most part I hope the app is intuitive and simple to use.
   However, there are a few tricks to know to make the most of it.
   <br />
   <br />
   <h4>Table Page:</h4>
   The table page has many functions:
   <l>
      <li>
         Data is displayed in a 'human-friendly' format. Capitalised words are used for characters. Negative numbers are highlighted in red.
      </li>
   </l>

   Ctrl+F is used to search through the statement data (these are not case sensitive). This will open a panel to the right of the displayed data. From here you can search each account for particular phrases. Dates can set by pressing the words date1 and date2 below the search bar. Certain categories can be excluded from the search by unchecking the checkboxes below the search bar. Finally regular expressions (RegEx) can be used for a more powerful search (a very good intro can be found at https://regexone.com/. 
   <br />
   <br />
   <h4>Plotting Page</h4>
   For help in using the plotting page simply press Ctrl+H. To process the command press Ctrl-Enter. Currently this page only outputs simple plots of the data and does not have predictive functionality.
