   The minimum amount required to plot any graph is to set the ydata parameter. This can be set the same as any other parameter, by typing the parameter followed by a colon, and the list of plotting parameters ended with a semi-colon. An example is given below:
   <center>
      <code>parameter: item1, item2, ..., itemN ;</code>
   </center>
<br>
   An example command to plot the Balance against the Date is given below:
<blockquote>
   <code>
       ydata: Balance;
       <br>
       xdata: Date;
   </code>
</blockquote>
White space is ignored, so is the case of the characters (i.e. you can use capitalised or lowercase letters). Any line that begins with a '#' is ignored and can be used to comment.

   <h3>The current list of commands are given as follows:</h3>
   <ul>
      <li> <b>Ydata</b>: Sets the data on the y-axis</li>
      <br />
      <li> <b>Xdata</b>: Sets the data on the x-axis</li>
      <br />
      <li> <b>Act_Num</b>: Chooses which account to plot data from</li>
   </ul>
</p>
<br />
<p>
   The data parameters can be set to any of the table headers on the table page.
   Alternatively set ydata or xdata to anything to get a full list
   of possible parameters.

   To run plotting with the inputted parameters hit Cntrl-Enter or press the OK button.
   The backend package used to plot the data is matplotlib so I have kept the syntax pretty similar to that.
