#PLOTTING

* Give the option of a graphical interface rather than the text one.

* Start on Predictions... Find patterns in incomings and outgoings and use these... Maybe have input from user (would this make it less reliable?). Want to learn how machine learning works... maybe this is a good opportunity? -Probably implement a simple predictor first.

* Add a feature to save and load scripts into the plotting page... Like other data analysis software such as MATLAB etc?
