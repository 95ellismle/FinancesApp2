##### Data Tables

* Add a function to google the description of transaction when clicked in the table.

* Use fuzzy logic for the search algorithm and highlight the search item in the table by changing the colour of the string etc... ** I'm not sure if a fuzzy search would be a good idea. The categorisation is a key feature of the data search and it works due to the search only finding specific data. Maybe using a different search bar for fuzzy search and not have that affect the bar chart **

* Add an autocomplete to the search bar.

* Order the data by balance for each day so an entry with a larger balance but smaller date doesn't appear after a smaller balance.

##### New Features

* Add a budgeting feature -track how much I spend on things (in which category) and tell me how much I have to spend in the future using predicted data. Have one of those nice graphs that show error in 2 lines with a filled in colour (like in climate prediction ).

### The following is a priority
 Make the data reading happen after the app has loaded. This should make it much easier to implement a load data feature and also make it easier to implement features such as passwords, GUI random data generation. If account data doesn't have account numbers attached (as in the data from Starling bank) a feature could be added to ask the user for a name for the account.
