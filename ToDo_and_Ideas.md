#DATA TABLES

* Add a function to google the description of transaction when clicked in the table.

* Use fuzzy logic for the search algorithm and highlight the search item in the table by changing the colour of the string etc...

* Add an autocomplete to the search bar.

* Order the data by balance for each day so an entry with a larger balance but smaller date doesn't appear after a smaller balance.

* Add a budgeting feature -track how much I spend on things (in which category) and tell me how much I have to spend in the future using predicted data. Have one of those nice graphs that show error in 2 lines with a filled in colour (like in climate prediction ).
