#DATA TABLES

* Add a function to google the description of transaction when clicked in the table.

<<<<<<< HEAD

* Use fuzzy logic for the search algorithm and highlight the search item in the table by changing the colour of the string etc...

* remove account numbers from the app

=======
* Add an autocomplete to the search bar.

#PLOTTING

* Give the option of a graphical interface rather than the text one.

* Make plots plot slightly different colours.

* Make plots plot all account numbers shown.

* Start on Predictions... Find patterns in incomings and outgoings and use these... Maybe have input from user (would this make it less reliable?). Want to learn how machine learning works... maybe this is a good opportunity? -Probably implement a simple predictor first.

* Add a feature to save and load scripts into the plotting page... Like other data analysis software such as MATLAB etc?
