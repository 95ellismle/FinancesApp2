#DATA TABLES

* Add a function to google the description of transaction when clicked in the table.

* Use fuzzy logic for the search algorithm and highlight the search item in the table by changing the colour of the string etc...

* Add an autocomplete to the search bar.

* Order the data by balance for each day so an entry with a larger balance but smaller date doesn't appear after a smaller balance.
